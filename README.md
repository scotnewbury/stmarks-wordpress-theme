St. Mark's Lodge, a lodge of Freemasons meeting under the Grand Lodge of New Hampshire have a WordPress Blog which utilized a stock theme and was looking outdated.

The new design incorporates a new color palette which matches the Lodge's logo and a new hero image which features the building rendered in watercolor.
